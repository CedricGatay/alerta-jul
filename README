*********************************************
Basic functionality
*********************************************

This a quick setup to get you up and running. Please refer to the 
documentation provided in the log4tailer project webpage at googlecode: 
http://code.google.com/p/log4tailer/

Installation:

Get the tar, Untar, cd bin and run :-)

If you want system wide (make sure to have python setuptools installed and system wide rights):

python setup.py install

Options:

Normal functionality:

log4tail pathToLogs 

will tail the logs with colors. 

log4tail -t "regex" pathToLogs

will tail the logs with colors and will emphasize the line that complies with the regex 

Throttling:

log4tail --throttle secs pathToLogs

It will slow down the tailing if your application logs very fast

Silent Mode:

log4tail -s -c configfile fullpathToLogs

Silent Mode activates SMTP email action and alerts will be sent to 
the address specified. Log4Tailer will request for the SMTP options 
interactively.
Silent Mode basically daemonizes Log4Tailer monitoring the logs. In
case of a FATAL will send the log trace to the address specified.
You must provide the full path to the logs.

Color config parameters:

You can specify your own colors by providing the -c parameter

log4tail -c config.txt pathToLogs

where config.txt, you can specify:

warn = yellow
info = green
debug = black
error = magenta
fatal = red

The above are the defaults and work well with a white or clear terminal background.

You can add specific logging levels by using the following syntax
     color.${level} = ${color}
 where ${level} is the level pattern you want to match (or any other pattern...) 
 and ${color} is the color you want to use.

Valid colors are, their background counterparts are prefixed with 'on_' : 
 * white
 * cyan
 * magenta
 * blue
 * yellow
 * green
 * red
 * black
 * skip
Levels with the skip color will not be printed out in your console 
   (fast and easy way to disable an annoying message)

Other options, please refer to :
 * the wiki in the original project webpage 
 * the log4tailconfig.txt file (heavily commented out)

For more explanation, details and options take a look at the UserGuide
provided.

Enjoy
